## :material-graph-outline: **Overview**

**BEHAVIOR** is a robotics challenge for everyday household tasks. It's a large-scale, human-grounded benchmark that tests a robot's capability in high-level reasoning, long-range locomotion, and dexterous bimanual manipulation in house-scale scenes.

This year's challenge features:

- **50 full-length household tasks** from our 1,000 activity collection, covering diverse activities like rearrangement, cooking, cleaning, and installation
- **10,000 teleoperated demonstrations** (1200+ hours) for training

BEHAVIOR challenge is co-hosted with the [Embodied Agent Interface Competition](https://foundation-models-meet-embodied-agents.github.io/eai_challenge/) at NeurIPS 2025.

## :material-database: **Dataset & Baselines**

### Teleoperated Demonstrations

**10,000 expert demonstrations** (1200+ hours) collected via teleoperation:

- Synchronized RGBD observations
- Object and part-level segmentation
- Ground-truth object states
- Robot proprioception and actions
- Skill and subtask annotations

[Dataset details →](./dataset.md)

### Baseline Methods

Pre-implemented training & evaluation pipelines for:

- **Behavioral Cloning baselines**: ACT, Diffusion Policy, BC-RNN, WB-VIMA - these are diverse imitation learning approaches that learn from the provided demonstrations.
- **Pre-trained Visuo-Language Action models**: OpenVLA and π0. These models are pretrained by a large amount of demonstration data, giving an alternative to models that need to be trained from scratch.

[Baselines details →](./baselines.md)

## :material-chart-box: **Evaluation & Rules**

The organizers reserve the right of final interpretation of the challenge rules. 

### Challenge Tracks

**Standard track:** Limited to provided robot onboard observations (RGB + depth + instance segmentation + proprioception).

**Privileged information track:** May query simulator for any information (object poses, scene point clouds, etc.).

🏆 **Prizes per track:**

1. 🥇 $1,000 + GeForce 5080
2. 🥈 $500 + (Jetson Orin Nano Super or $1,000 Brev Credits)
3. 🥉 $300 + $500 Brev Credits

Top 3 teams from each track will be invited to present at the workshop!

### Evaluation Metrics

**Primary metric (for ranking):** Task success rate averaged across 50 tasks. Partial credit given as fraction of satisfied BDDL goal predicates.

**Secondary metrics (efficiency):**

- **Simulated time** - Total simulation steps × time per step
- **Distance navigated** - Total base movement distance
- **Hand displacement** - Cumulative hand movement
